    <p style="text-align:center">In this work, we propose a NFT based application using Azure Block chain technology. The overall application could be decoupled into three steps: Select, mint, and Aggregate. We will have advantages in the aspects like Visibility, Traceability, Security because of tokenization and privacy. The main moto of this project is that, We can buy and sell online, frequently with cryptocurrency, and they are generally encoded with the same underlying software as many cryptos. In future, Minting new NFTs can serve as an additional stream for regular ol’ fundraising. Someone buys an NFT from your nonprofit--—or an NFT artist you’ve partnered with—and your org receives a donation and also NFTs can be employed in real estate in a variety of ways. It can be used to make real estate ownership transparent, for starters. You could, for example, place the ownership of a piece of land or property on a blockchain and allow others to see it.
