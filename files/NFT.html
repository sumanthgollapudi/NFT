      <p>  NFT is a digital asset that represents real-world objects like art, music, in-game items and videos. 
NFTâ€™s are tokens like images, but they are unique to each other.</p>

<p>They are bought and sold online, frequently with cryptocurrency, and they are generally encoded with the same underlying software as many cryptos.</p>

<p>To implement an NFT in applications, (ERC 721 or ERC 20) but we follow ERC 721 standards are introduced by the Ethereum platform.</p>

<p>So, here we can see a standards called ERC 721. Which is represented as standard for representing ownership of NFT tokens. Because each token is unique and also contains functions like libraries which are needed to be implemented in our project.</p>

<p>We can follow ERC 20 also but the main difference is ERC20 tokens are interchangeable and represent a single entity, whereas ERC721 tokens represent a collection of assets. So mostly follows ERC 721.</p>
